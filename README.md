## My process

There wasn't really that much to this project. The tricky part was figuring out the dimensions used.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I didn't learn too much, I mainly did this project as a way to improve my skills. However I did learn a few tricks to take better control of CSS background images, but that's about it.
